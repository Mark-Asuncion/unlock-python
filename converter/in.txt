#Python Indentation

"Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code."

begin_code
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")
end_code

"Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:"

begin_code
if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")
end_code

"The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one."

begin_code
if 5 > 2:
     print("Five is greater than two!") 
if 5 > 2:
     print("Five is greater than two!") 
end_code

"You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:"

begin_code
if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")
end_code

#Python Variables

"In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:"

begin_code
x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"
end_code


#Comments

"Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.

Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:"

begin_code
#This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")
end_code
